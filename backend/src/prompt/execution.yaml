  Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
  Action Input: the input to the action
  Observation: the result of the action
  ... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
  Thought: I now know the final answer
  Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question

  IMPORTANT: Stop after generating an Action and Action Input. NEVER generate an Observation. The system will provide the Observation for you.
