# Quickstart: View Skill Style and Layout Fix

This feature improves the legibility and structure of the skill documentation popup.

## Verification Steps

1. **Start Application**: Ensure both backend and frontend are running (or use Docker).
2. **Open Skill Dashboard**: Navigate to the skill management view.
3. **Open View Skill Popup**: Click the **View Skill** button on any skill card.
4. **Verify Layout**:
    - The skill name should be prominent at the top.
    - The skill description should appear immediately below the name.
    - There should be a clear vertical gap between the name and the description.
5. **Verify Styles**:
    - In **Light Mode**: All text should be easily readable (primary text should be black or near-black).
    - In **Dark Mode**: All text should be easily readable (primary text should be white or light gray).
    - The description should use a "secondary" style (e.g., slightly smaller or grayed out) to distinguish it from the title.
