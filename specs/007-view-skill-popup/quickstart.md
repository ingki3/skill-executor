# Quickstart: View Skill Popup

This feature moves skill documentation from an inline card expansion to a focused modal dialog and fixes visibility issues.

## 1. Locate Skill
Open the Skill Management dashboard and find any registered skill.

## 2. Open Documentation
Click the **View Skill** button (formerly "View Docs").

## 3. Interact with Popup
- **Read**: The documentation renders in a centered popup with clear, high-contrast text.
- **Scroll**: If the content is long, you can scroll within the popup.
- **Close**: Click the "Close" button, click the backdrop, or press **ESC**.

## 4. Verify Styles
The text should be clearly visible in both light and dark themes.
